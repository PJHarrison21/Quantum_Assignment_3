This repository contains all source code written for the third assignment of Quantum Computing 746.

## Requirements

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

## Usage

Before any the code can be run, you must first set up the vitual environment. This can be done from the terminal with the following command:

```
sh setup.sh
```

This will use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install any necessary packages and ensures the `out/` directory is present.

You can then open the *Jupyter* notebook (`qaoa-maxcut.ipynb`) with your tool of choice. The code can then be run and changed using the provided documentation in the notebook itself.
